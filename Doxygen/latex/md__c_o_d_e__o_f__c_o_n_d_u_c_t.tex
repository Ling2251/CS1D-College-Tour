This program is a software that reads data and stores it in a data structure. The program must have the ability to hold the names of at least 20 college campuses (the initial data contains 11 campuses) and their corresponding traditional souvenirs (up to seven per campus). Also the program will be used to allow perspective college students to plan their college experience. Last the program will provide the ability to modify information related to the traditional souvenirs (such as adding new souvenirs, changing a price of a souvenir, or deleting a souvenir).\hypertarget{md__c_o_d_e__o_f__c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Our Ruls}\label{md__c_o_d_e__o_f__c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md2}
