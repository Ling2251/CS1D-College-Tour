# CS1D College Tour Application 

## Scope Of the Program

This program is a software that reads data and stores it in a data structure. 
The program must have the ability to hold the names of at least 20 college campuses 
(the initial data contains 11 campuses)	and their corresponding	traditional 
souvenirs (up to seven per campus). Also the program will be used to allow perspective
college students to plan their college experience. Last the program will provide the
ability to modify information related to the traditional souvenirs (such as adding
new souvenirs, changing a price of a souvenir, or deleting a souvenir).

## Our Ruls

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

  advances of any kind

acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.
